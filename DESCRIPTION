# Capillaria
# RNA-Seq was performed on stool samples containing (potential) Capillaria species eggs collected from humans in Liberia. Capillaria is
# suspected based off of morphological analysis as well as some rRNA gene sequences. RNA-Seq from stool was used in lieu of DNA-Seq due
# to ample contaminating sequences. Samples were preserved in RNA later and poly-A tail selected in order to enrich for eukaryotic
# transcripts, potentially reducing contaminating bacterial reads. Samples were determined to be singularly infected by Kato-Katz 
# and PCR (I think). There were still likely be contamination by human reads as well as other eukaryotic parasites (various protozoa).
