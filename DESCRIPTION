# Capillaria
# RNA-Seq was performed on stool samples containing (potential) Capillaria species eggs collected from humans in Liberia. Capillaria is
# suspected based off of morphological analysis as well as some rRNA gene sequences. RNA-Seq from stool was used in lieu of DNA-Seq due
# to ample contaminating sequences. Samples were preserved in RNA later and poly-A tail selected in order to enrich for eukaryotic
# transcripts, potentially reducing contaminating bacterial reads. Samples were determined to be singularly infected by Kato-Katz 
# and PCR (I think). There were still likely be contamination by human reads as well as other eukaryotic parasites (various protozoa). 
#
# Sample Composition:
#
# Single stool sample containing Capillaria like eggs. PolyA selection. RNA-Seq HiSeqXXX using XXX kit 2xXXX
#
# Computational Strategy:
# 1. Trim reads using TRIMMOMATIC
# 3. Create contigs using SPAdes assembler
#   a. start with just contigs greater than read length
#     i. Do not map contig to human/bacterial genomes prior to taxonomic assesment, if they make up majority of contigs remove them
#   b. consider using orphan reads as well
# 4. Translate contigs in all 6 possible ORFs, blast using DIAMOND (will need to adjust parameters for evalue, %id, etc.) 
#   a. against "reference" proteome (Trichuria trichuris)
#   b. against NCBI nr database
# 5. Maybe use Mark's tally_hits python scripts to process output of blastx
